        <h3>In a nutshell:</h3>
        <h3>If you distribute / sell a product that uses GPL code, you need to provide the source and it needs to be GPL.</h3>
        <h3>Private use is fine.</h3>

        <h2>GPL</h2>
        <h3>Selling plugins or themes is ok, but they're GPL.</h3>
        <h3>The consensus is that you're being payed for customizations and support.</h3>
        <h3>Generally images and stylesheets are not considered GPL.</h3>

        <h2>GPL</h2>

        <h2>GPL</h2>
        <h3>Linking to GPL code means that your code must be GPL.</h3>

        <h3>Watch for simple licenses with extra things.</h3>
