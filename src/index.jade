        h1 IANAL
        h2
          | (I am not a lawyer)
        h3 So take this with a grain of salt.
        h3 Even if I was, this is just a presentation.
        h3 When in doubt, hire a lawyer.
        h3 Advice on the internet != lawyer.

      +slide

      +slide
        h2 Copyright
        h3 Berne Convention.
        h3 A bit of text, some code, a drawing.
        h3 Instant copyright!
        h3
          | (Registration not required.)
        h3 Expression of an idea and not the idea itself.
        h3 Copyright expires.

      +slide
        h2 You have the right...
        h3(style='text-decoration: line-through') to paaaarty
        h3 to copy
        h3 to not copy
          | (but there's fair-use)
        h3 to sue
          | (statutory damages)
        
      +slide
        h2 Who owns the code?
        h2 You!

      +slide
        h2 But...
        h3 You're contracting / freelancing.
        h3 You're fulltime and your contract says otherwise.

      +slide
        h2 Licenses
        h3 Permissions granted to others.
        h3 Without assigning the copyright to them.
        h3 You can dual license.

        img(src='images/growth.png', style='width: 762px; height: 445px;')
        h5 License evolution on Github, as of 2015.

      +slide
        h2 No license
        h3 You have no right.
        h3 Even if it's on Github.
        h3 No license is not public domain.
        h3 Public domain is tricky.

      +slide
        h2 GPL
        h3 In a nutshell:
        h3 If you distribute / sell a product that uses GPL code, you need to provide the source and it needs to be GPL.
        h3 Private use is fine.
        
      +slide
        h2 GPL
        h3 Version 2: Liberty or death
        h3 Version 3: Tivoization, patents.

        h2 GPL
        h3 Wordpress, Drupal are GPL.
        h3 Hosting your website is not distributing.

      +slide
        h2 GPL
        h3 Selling plugins or themes is ok, but they're GPL.
        h3 The consensus is that you're being payed for customizations and support.
        h3 Generally images and stylesheets are not considered GPL.
        h3 None of this has been proven in a court of law.
        h3 Bridging is sometimes ok.

      +slide
        h2 GPL
        h3 When GPL 2 was written there was no SaaS.

        h3 AGPL fixed it.
        h3 GPL 3 avoided it.
        
      +slide
        h2 GPL
        h3 Linking to GPL code means that your code must be GPL.
        h3 LGPL was created to avoid that.
        h3 Key: dynamic linking.
        h3 Until iOS 8 you couldn't dynamically link.
        h3 Libraries moved to another license.
        
      +slide
        h2 Appstores

        h3 Android, Linux appstores are fine.

        h3 Some say you can via a 'dedication'.
        h3 This is difficult in EU due to 'moral rights'.
        h3 sqlite

      +slide
        h2 Unlicense
        h3 Tries to put code in the public domain via a license.
        h3 Doesn't quite work due to 'moral rights'.

        h3 Watch for simple licenses with extra things.
        h3 e.g. react's PATENTS file.

        h2 And then...
        h3 You decide to change or add another license.
        h3 You want to sue someone.
        h3 You are getting sued because somebody contributed "bad" code.
